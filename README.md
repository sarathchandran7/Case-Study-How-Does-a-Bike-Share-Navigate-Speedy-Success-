# Case-Study-How-Does-a-Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success-
This case study was done as a part of  Capstone project for Google Big data analytics professional certificate.
In this case study, I have performed data analysis for a fictional bike-share company in order to help them attract more riders. 

Markup :  ## Introduction ##
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two=-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. As part of an analysis project, I have obtained a data set of all Cyclistic trips taken from january 2021 to June 2021.I was given the opportunity to conduct a case study on Cyclistic to analyze the data and provide insights on the users’ behavior.

Markup :  ## About the company ##
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to
any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One 
approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and
annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who
purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Markup :  ## Goal of case study ##
Moreno : The director of marketing, has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do
that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual
riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
